# Welcome to The Scientific Room!üöÄ

This is a website to showcase scientific viddeos. Here you can learn everything: From light and electromagnetism to black holes and the baheviour of time. Just click on a video and start learning about your Universe.

## Goals of this website

I made this website because I wanted to show my abilities as a developer while writing code in a project that I am passionate about. So yes, the main goal for this website is to serve as a job to show on my portfolio as a proof of my abilities.

You can learn more about the reasons and background story that took me to create The Scientific Room by going to the "Reasons of Existance" section of the website.

## Technologies used on the project

The Scientific Room is completely built on vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I also used SASS to organize and reuse my code while writing most parts of the CSS. 

The website also uses media queries to make it responsive and adaptable to all mobile devices.

I also want to add that everything is made from scratch. I began to make the design on Figma, and when I finished it, I started to work on the HTML and CSS of the main page and to code all the components until I finally reached the final result.

## Origin of the videos

All videos embedded to the website come from different content creators on YouTube. All the credit for the videos goes to their respective creators.
