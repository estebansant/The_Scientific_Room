                        &emsp; Since I was a kid, science caught my attention. I used to make little experiments mixing flavors of soda and thought “This is how being a scientist feels like”. Since then, many years have passed, I grew up and my way to see life changed, the things that I liked also changed, but that focus on discovering new things and on science never left.  <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; When I was in high school, Stephen Hawking died. That event lit a spark in me. With his death I started to read about his life, his work, and the things that he did for humanity. That is when I fell in love with the universe. Black holes, neutron stars, wormholes, planets, galaxies… Those are things that truly caught my attention, and I started to spend hours reading and watching videos on YouTube about them. <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; With coding, the story was a little bit different. On 2020 I started to make money on internet by working from home, and I also discovered that websites are a really good source of passive income (depending if your website is successful and appears on the Google results or not). But this drive to make money from home took me to start a website about drones using WordPress. I spent many hours writing blog articles about that subject. I realized that there were many things that I wanted to do for the website, but I couldn't really make them work well. In that process I found terms like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, that I really didn't know what they meant. <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; This project never saw the success that I had in mind for it, I couldn't make it reach the first pages on Google and its monthly visitors were like 30 o 40 users per month, which most part of them came from Russia or China (basically they were bots). <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; Nevertheless, this idea of making websites kept running through my mind, and that's how in 2021 I bought a subscription on Platzi and started taking their online courses. I have to say that this step was a game changer for me. I really learned what those terms (that once were strange for me) really meant, and then I also learned how to use them and make amazing things by writing code. <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; This idea of working on a tech company, or working as a freelancer making websites started to grow in my head, but I needed a personal project to show them what I am really capable to do. I thought that combining both of my passions: Physics and coding; would be a great idea for a website, and that is how The Scientific Room was born. <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; This project is a proof to the world about the things that I can do, what makes me passionate about life and keep me on going. I mixed content created by youtubers and scientists who inspired me to study physics and shaped the way how I see the world, with the magic that you can make while writing some lines of code. <br/><br/>

                        &emsp; If you reached reading this far, I want to thank you with all my heart for taking your time to read this part of my life. My plan from here is to keep developing my skills, work on new projects to add in my portfolio, and to never stop learning. <br/> <br/> <br/>

                        Thanks for your attention and your time. <br/> <br/>
                        Best regards, <br/>
                        Esteban.
